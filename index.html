    <p> Cats generally have more personal hygiene. Their fur is thick enough to brush off any and all dirt or mud, and they lick themselves clean so they remain perfectly clean and cute.</p>
    <h2> They are incredibly smart </h2>

    <p> Cats are known as natural predators, but in their ancestry and their housecat friends, that have broad hunting strategies that vary from furball to furball. That means every single cat is unique! </p>
    <h2> They can save YOUR LIFE. </h2>

    <p>Believe it or not, cats can save lives, and have multiple times. For example, a cat named Fluffy saved his owner, Ron Williams, after Williams had a fall and was unable to move for several hours. Fluffy alerted Williams to his situation by meowing and nudging him, allowing Williams to reach his phone and call for help. This is just one example of how cats can save YOUR LIFE.  </p>
    
    <h2> Cats are more suited for activites </h2>

    <p> Kitty cats aren't just adorable and smart, they can do practically anything with humans. There are a multitude of examples of where cats can go mountain climbing, swimming, or walking. Have you seen a dog mountain climbing? Didn't think so. </p>
